This Rail Fence Cypher takes a plain-text message and a numeric key, cipher/de-cipher the given text using Rail Fence algorithm. The rail fence cipher (also called a zigzag cipher) is a form of transposition cipher. It derives its name from the way in which it is encoded. This app preforms two actions 1) encrypt a plain text document / message depending on the key number you use and 2) decrypt the same plain text document / message.

In the rail fence cipher, the plaintext is written downwards diagonally on successive "rails" of an imaginary fence, then moving up when the bottom rail is reached, down again when the top rail is reached, and so on until the whole plaintext is written out. The ciphertext is then read off in rows.
